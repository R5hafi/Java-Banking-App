https://www.codewithc.com/online-bank-management-system-project-java/

Check List
The program itself:

• Must contain at least 2 different classes, in addition to Main. 

• Use ArrayList and use an Arraylist of objects or a HashMap.

• Must involve file IO.

• Needs some type of searching and sorting

• Must not crash (generally) :)

BrainStorming:
Classes - Multiple accounts(checking/savings)
Array - Transaction List
Import/Print File - Print Transaction List
Method - Withdraw/Deposit
Searching/sorting - Searching Transaction List
Loops - Will be used in methods and searching and sorting algorithms
Objects 
ArrayList
HashMap - 
If statements - (Used in multiple systems)
2D Array 
Switch Statement
Recursion

The Program Will:

Allow the user to open Multiple accounts
Allow the user to etransfer and deposit on multiple accounts
Allow the user to view a Transaction History list 
Allow the user to search and sort for transactions based on amount
Allow the user to view account information (e.g.) Name, Birthday, Address, Security Number
...

Steps: 
1.) Make a login portal where username and password are connected to data, look up a GUI tutorial for this.
2.) Display account info which should consist of balance, transactions, deposits, etc. This can be done through using a data file to write to the screen.
3.) After all info is set, make a button or something else that leads to the option of making a eTransfer or deposit. 
4.) Using a searching algorithm give user option to look for transaction by amount.
5.) In another data file contain basic account info like name, bday, address, security number, etc.
